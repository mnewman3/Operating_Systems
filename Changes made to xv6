Changes made to xv6
*********************************
> added try.c in root folder for testing (NOT CURRENTLY WORKING)

> added try.c to EXTRA=/ section of Makefile (line 243)
> added "_try\" to UPROGS=/ section of Makefile (line 173)

> added trace prototype to user.h (line 26)
> added trace system call number to syscall.h (line 23)

> added "extern int sys_trace(void);" to syscall.c (line 97)
> added "[SYS_trace]   sys_trace" to syscall.c (line 125) in last place of syscalls array to match with trace system call number in syscall.h

> added "SYSCALL(trace)" to usys.S (line 32)

> added sys_trace() function to sysproc.c (starting @ line 97)
	- just sets tracing var in proc and returns scc (system call count)

> added "int tracing;" to proc struct in proc.h (line 69)
> added "int scc;" (system call count) to proc.h (line 70) for per process system call counting

> modified syscall(void) in syscall.c (starting line 143) to add to scc and check for tracing then output based on that
	- this is system call entrance function: check at every call if tracing enabled

> modified allocproc() funtion in proc.c (lines 73 - 75) to clear out tracing and scc vars in proc struct upon allocation of new proc (per-process info) for new process


Notes/ TODO
*****************************

*** important ***
> Still need to make sure tracing and scc vars in proc are cleared properly when a new process is created
	- currently sets these to 0 upon allocation in allocproc() in proc.c
	- not sure if this is sufficient, may want to memset() to 0 instead of just setting equal to 0 ... needs to be investigated



> Find way to output name of system call being made (not just number)
	- may be able to use argstr to do this from in syscall.c

> Testing
